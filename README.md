# Twitch Chat Marker

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This small web app was created to help smaller Twitch streamers who aim to keep up with all messages in their chat. This is done by introducing a marker in the chatbox which makes it clear where the user is up to in terms of messages, and can be moved up and down.

### Installation
1. Ensure that Node.js and npm are both installed
2. Open the command line in the directory of this repository and run `npm install`, to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server at `localhost:3000`. The web page should automatically open in your default browser.

### Future plans
- Render channel emotes, badges
- Global keyboard shortcuts for moving marker
